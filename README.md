# activity-recognition

This project compares different methods (i.e. SVM, RandomForest, Logistic Regression) to classify (and cluster with k-Means) human activities from data collected with a smartphone by only one person. Moreover it evaluates the models accuracy for data which have been generated by different persons. It also makes predictions to determine which person performed the activities "walking" and "running". This project was focused on feature engineering and uses a sliding window approach to genereate robust features.
